    Thank you for participating in this study. Your contribution will provide our team insight
    on how we can improve the Geo-context and COVID-19 in Missouri dashboard so that users will
     be able to explore and visualize data in ways that are most useful to their individual goals.

    <br><br>
     You will evaluate two dashboards:<br>
     1.	Risk Categories – Select, aggregate and visualize risk totals from 6 risk categories at 
     the Missouri county-level. Determine which counties have the highest/lowest risk and apply a 
     rural-urban continuum filter.<br>
     2.	Counties – Visualize over 50 + risk factors from 6 risk categories at the Missouri 
     county-level. Learn about the risk category make-up of specific counties and how risk factors 
     compare to the Missouri county averages. See the weekly covid-19 cases/deaths count from the
    beginning of 2020-present.<br>
     

<br>
    <span class='title'>Procedure:</span><br>
1. You will begin by taking the "User Survey".
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - All data will be tied to a random, 10-digit ID generated at the beginning of the evaluation; thus, 
                             evaluator answers are anonymous. The "User Survey" gives us insight about the evaluator population.
<br>2.	You then will complete a series of 2 tests per dashboard (4 tests total):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Tasks - you will perform a set of tasks where mouse-clicks and task duration will be captured. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Read the task carefully.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Click "start task" as seen in the image below, and then complete the task.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Once you have completed the task, click "complete task"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) A new task will appear, repeat steps 1-4

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Survey - you will be prompted with questions regarding your experience using the dashboard.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Answer each question by selecting a value in the 1-5 scale shown below.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Answer all questions.
