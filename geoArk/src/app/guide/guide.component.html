                The Risk Categories Dashboard gives a high-level view of risk throughout the counties of Missouri. Users can generate a customized
                risk assessment by selecting different combinations of risk categories. A rural-urban contiuum filter can be applied to visualize
                the relationship between risk and how rural or urban a county is.
